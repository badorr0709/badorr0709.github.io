				When it came to create the images, I wanted to create something that would work with the music and try out the live coding. So, the process when it came to that I created multiple files that had style going on. From that I found that is was hard to get the proper timing of when you code add or comment other things out to make sure that it did not create a bad reaction. The song that I pick is more of a depressing song and is about someoneâ€™s mental state, so I wanted to create images that started off as being clears and start becoming more erratic and chaotic. So, then there is a point where I try and match the colors being displayed to the emotion of the song as well. Also because of the pacing of the song I made this longer than a minute because with this song I felt that each transition needed more time so I choice to play out the whole song instead. Also with live coding I realized that I needed to add comments to the code to tell me what I needed to uncomment first and also added some instructions for me to follow while live coding which seemed to help.
				<br>From the feedback that I got I decided to create another video of live coding to fix some of my mistakes from that. The biggest issues were the timing so I practice the time a bit after the first video so I could speed up the like coding. Also there felt that there where some backgrounds/transitions that needed to be smoothed out the just had a sudden change and was to much snapping. So I took the feed back form them and created another live code to the same song.
