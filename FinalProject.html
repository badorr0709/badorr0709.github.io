		When it come to the visuals I worked with some friend can double checked to make sure that what I was creating was 
		something that they found interesting to watch as well. So I worked with and got feed back from 2 other people on
		how I should tweek the visuals and the pattern being displayed. I wanted to create something that someone could and
		would be willing to look out for long periods of time. Some the feed back that I got some my friends they seems to
		agree with that. Currenly it is Not displaying the Correct simulation.

        When it came to working on this project there where a few issues that had being going on that had slowed
		down my work flow. I needed to create a simulation since I was late to getting that project done. I really
		wanted to focus more on the interactivaty between the OSC software and the simulation rather then creating fades
		and overlays for them. The biggest issue that had impeded my work was getting the node.js server running so 
		I could communicate between the website and the app on my phone. I was running into errors that was not letting
		the server run for a while so i could not work on anything till I got that working. I went to office hours and got
		the bug resolved. the issue that I was running into was something that was Windows specific with the naming of the
		files that was not letting the server work for a bit. Once that was resolved I started working on what I can do for 
		interactivaty with the similations. After that was done I went into the force and messed around to start working on 
		some ideas for how I wanted some of my simulations to look. I spent some time tweeking some of the visual looks in
		The Force then converted the code over and then tweeked the code more once I added that into the website. When I was
		creating the visualisations i wanted to make sure that there was some contral over the colors but i wanted to make
		that some of them would blend togeather and mix some more instead of just being s simple color or red, green, or blue.
		Also i implomented a way to change the relolution and the speed in which the simulation runs.
		<br/>
		When it come to the artistis point of view that I was working towards for this project I originally wanted recreate a
		fluid like simulation. I feel with the first simulation that I was working on I was able to meet the requirments for that.
		From there though I wanted to work on combine the FBM with the simulation and just try and combine them to see what is possible. 
		The result where interesting because I dont thing my computer was able to handle the intensity of the processes being run on my
		GPU. But it did at some points when it was running a gassy like liquid depending on where you left your mouse courser but did not 
		create the results that I was hoping for in the end but was still fun and interesting.

		To get access to my code just go to my github and all my is in a folder in my website repository called FinalProg.
